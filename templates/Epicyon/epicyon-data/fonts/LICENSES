# Note

There are varying opinions out there on the internets about the compatibility of Open Font License with GPL projects. However, gnu.org does list it as compatible - or at least not incompatible - when bundled with other software, which in practice is the case here. It writes:

SIL Open Font License 1.1

The Open Font License (including its original release, version 1.0) is a free copyleft license for fonts. Its only unusual requirement is that when selling the font, you must redistribute it bundled with some software, rather than alone. Since a simple Hello World program will satisfy the requirement, it is harmless. Neither we nor SIL recommend the use of this license for anything other than fonts.
