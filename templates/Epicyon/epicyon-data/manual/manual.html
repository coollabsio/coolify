<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><em>“Every new beginning comes from some other beginning’s
end.”</em></p>
<p>– Seneca</p>
<p><em>The fediverse</em> is a set of federated servers, typically using
a communication protocol called <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub">ActivityPub</a> which was
devised by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg">social working
group</a> within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). At present it is
mostly used for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblogging</a>,
although ActivityPub is sufficiently general that it can also be used
for a variety of other purposes.</p>
<p>The word <em>fediverse</em> (federated universe) appears to have
originated around 2012 as the first <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identi.ca">identi.ca</a> website was
ending and the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump.io">pump.io</a> project was
beginning. The ActivityPub protocol was initially called
<em>ActivityPump</em>, due to the influence which pump.io had upon its
creation. Fediverse servers are typically referred to as “instances”,
but they are really just websites which can speak with each other using
the vocabulary of ActivityPub. Choosing an instance is the same as
choosing a website that you trust to handle your data. This is <em>the
social web</em>.</p>
<p>Servers such as <a
href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon">Mastodon</a> are well known,
but these are aimed at large scale deployments on powerful hardware
running within data centers, making use of content distribution networks
(CDN) and due to their large number of dependencies requiring someone
with a high level of systems administration skill to maintain. Epicyon
is designed for the opposite situation where it is only intended to have
a single user or a small number of users (less than ten) running from
your home location or on a modest VPS and where maintenance is extremely
trivial such that it’s possible to keep an instance running for long
durations with minimal intervention.</p>
<p>Epicyon is part of the <a
href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web">small web</a> category
of internet software, in that it is intended to scale via federation
rather than to scale vertically via resource intensive and expensive
hardware. Think many small communicating nodes rather than a small
number of large servers. Also, in spite of the prevailing great
obsession with scale, not everything needs to. You can federate with a
small number of servers for a particular purpose - such as running a
club or hackspace - and that’s ok. It supports both the server-to-server
(S2S) and client-to-server (C2S) versions of the ActivityPub protocol,
with <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication">basic
auth</a> for C2S authentication.</p>
<p><a
href="https://uxdesign.cc/mastodon-is-antiviral-design-42f090ab8d51?gi=9baf6195c60b">Anti-virality</a>
is a common design approach in the fediverse, and Epicyon also follows
this convention by having chronological timelines and avoiding lists of
trending things or ranking profiles by numbers of followers. Recent
hashtags are presented <em>in alphabetical order</em> to avoid any
frequency bias. Typically if a post gets more than ten likes then its
count will only show as <em>“10+”</em>, to try to avoid getting fixated
upon making numbers go up at the expense of more considered forms of
interaction.</p>
<p>It is hardly possible to visit many sites on the web without your
browser loading and running a large amount of javascript. Epicyon takes
a minimalist approach where its web interface only uses <a
href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage">HTML</a> and <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a>. You can
disable javascript, or use a browser which doesn’t have javascript
capability, and the user experience is unchanged. Lack of javascript
also rules out a large area of potential attack surface.</p>
<p>Another common concern is being able to keep instances running.
Instance abandonment creates a lot of disruption, and it’s often related
to the amount of effort that it takes to keep things going. To avoid the
maintenance burden becoming prohibitive, Epicyon is implemented in a
simple manner with very few dependencies and no database. All data is
just files in a directory, and upgrades are also straightforward. This
degree of simplicity runs counter to the current trend within the
software industry towards complex frameworks and large scale databases
with elaborate and rapidly evolving dependencies.</p>
<p>Epicyon also includes some lightweight organizing features, such as
calendar, events and sharing economy features.</p>
<p>It’s time to make the web a social space once more, to reject
centralized systems and prioritize people rather than business
models.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>You will need python version 3.7 or later.</p>
<p>On a Debian based system:</p>

<p>The following instructions install Epicyon to the
<strong>/opt</strong> directory. It’s not essential that it be installed
there, and it could be in any other preferred directory.</p>
<p>Clone the repo, or if you downloaded the tarball then extract it into
the <strong>/opt</strong> directory.</p>

<h2 id="installing-on-onion-or-i2p-domains">Installing on Onion or i2p
domains</h2>
<p>If you don’t have access to the clearnet, or prefer to avoid it, then
it’s possible to run an Epicyon instance easily from your laptop. There
are scripts within the <em>deploy</em> directory which can be used to
install an instance on a Debian or Arch/Parabola operating system. With
some modification of package names they could be also used with other
distros.</p>
<p>Please be aware that such installations will not federate with
ordinary fediverse instances on the clearnet, unless those instances
have been specially modified to do so. But onion instances will federate
with other onion instances and i2p instances with other i2p
instances.</p>
<h1 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h1>
<p>Unlike some other instance types, Epicyon is really easy to upgrade.
It only requires a git pull to obtain the changes from the upstream
repo, then set permissions and restart the daemon.</p>

<p>To avoid running out of disk space you will want to clear down old
inbox posts. Posts from your instance outboxes will be unaffected.</p>
<p>Create an archive script
<strong>/usr/bin/epicyon-archive</strong>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre

<h1 id="registering-accounts">Registering accounts</h1>
<p>You will notice that within the systemd daemon the
<em>registration</em> option is set to <em>open</em>. In a browser if
you navigate to the URL of your instance then you should see a
<em>Register</em> button. The first account to register becomes the
administrator.</p>
<p>To avoid spam signups, or overloading the system, there is a maximum
number of accounts for the instance which by default is set to 10.</p>
<h1 id="the-importance-of-good-defaults">The importance of good
defaults</h1>
<p>Many social network systems have bad defaults, and that is for the
purpose of maximizing the number of users and their level of engagement.
Bad defaults usually create a combination of <em>addiction patterns</em>
and <em>involuntary oversharing</em> and hence a viral network effect of
escalating outrage and dependency. On small fediverse servers we can
avoid having bad defaults, because there is no profit motive or drive
for massive notoriety.</p>
<p>Good defaults tend to be a little more private and avoid the
addiction to making numbers go up or achieving <em>notoriety at any
social cost</em>. This puts fediverse instances like Epicyon at a slight
disadvantage compared to ruthlessly commercial systems, but it’s an
explicit trade-off in order to minimize the harms which can arise within
social networks. So you won’t find any high scores tables or trending
items.</p>
<h1 id="logging-in">Logging in</h1>
<p>In a browser if you navigate to the URL of your instance and enter
the username and password that you previously registered. The first time
that you log in it will show a series of introduction screens which
prompt you to add a profile picture, name and bio description.</p>

<h1 id="account-profiles">Account Profiles</h1>
<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial setup</h2>
<p>When you register an account on the instance the first thing that you
may want to do is to add more profile details and change your
preferences. From the main timeline screen select the top banner to move
to your profile and then select the edit button, which usually looks
like a pen and is adjacent to the logout icon.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Profile basic details</figcaption>

<h3 id="describe-yourself">Describe yourself</h3>
<p>Add an appropriate description of youself, which doesn’t resemble the
type of thing which would appear on a spam account. When other fediverse
users are judging a follow request from you they will want to know that
you are a real person and not a spammer or troll.</p>
<h3 id="premium-account">Premium Account</h3>
<p>There is an option to set your account as “premium”. This is intended
for an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans">OnlyFans</a>-like
situation in which followers need to subscribe with some payment before
making a follow request to receive your posts. If this option is
selected then recent posts on your profile won’t be shown to
unauthorized viewers and the terminology of donations is switched to
subscriptions. You will need to set a link where followers can register,
and ask fans to specify their fediverse handle so that you can approve
it.</p>
<p>A difference with corporate content subscription services is that the
federated nature of instances means that once a post has been sent out
to fans/followers then you won’t have any control over what they
subsequently do with your content. So they could boost/announce posts to
non-subscribers, for example.</p>
<h3 id="other-fediverse-accounts">Other fediverse accounts</h3>
<p>If you have any other fediverse accounts on different instances then
you might want to add URLs for those. You can set the languages which
you can read, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1">two
letter abbreviations</a>. This helps to avoid having posts from other
people within your timeline which you can’t read.</p>
<h3 id="expiring-posts">Expiring posts</h3>
<p>You can set your posts to expire after a number of days. If this
value is zero then the instance will keep your posts indefinitely.</p>
<h3 id="quitting-the-website-formerly-known-as-twitter">Quitting the
website formerly known as Twitter</h3>
<p>If you are coming to the fediverse as an exile from the website
formerly known as Twitter then you may want to select the option to
remove any Twitter posts from your timeline. Sometimes people want to
make a clean break from Twitter and have no further involvement with
it.</p>
<p>As Twitter turns into an information black hole populated by
generative AI grifters it’s expected that posts on that site may become
no longer visible on the open web, and even when they are visible they
may be unreliable or fake content generated in whole or in part by
algorithms.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-contact-details">Alternative contact details</h3>
<p>You can set additional contact details, such as email, XMPP and
Matrix addresses. So if people want to contact you for private <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end
secure</a> chat then they can do so. The fediverse was never designed
for end-to-end security - it is primarily for public communications -
and so it’s better to leave secure private chat to the apps which are
specialized for that purpose.</p>
<h3 id="filtering-and-blocking">Filtering and blocking</h3>
<p>If you want to block particular fediverse accounts or instances then
you can enter those in the <em>blocked account</em> section. There
should be one account per line.</p>
<h3 id="geolocation-spoofing">Geolocation spoofing</h3>
<p>Within the <em>filtering and blocking</em> section you can also set a
city which will be used for geolocation spoofing. When you post a photo,
instead of removing all metadata spoofed metadata will be added in order
to consistently fool the machine learning systems behind web crawlers or
scrapers, and create a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation
bias</a> effect where the surveillance systems become increasingly
confident in an erroneous conclusion. Setting a city somewhere near to
your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zone</a> is
preferable, so that it matches your typical pattern of daily posting
activity without giving away your real location.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-your-website-or-blog">Verifying your website or
blog</h3>
<p>It is possible to indicate that a website or blog belongs to you by
linking it to your profile screen. Within the <em>head</em> html section
of your website or blog index page include a line similar to:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre
class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">&lt;</span><span class="kw">link</span> <span class="er">rel</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;me&quot;</span> <span class="er">href</span><span class="ot">=</span><span class="st">&quot;https://YourEpicyonDomain/@YourNickname&quot;</span> <span class="dt">/&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you edit and then publish your profile, with the <em>website</em>
and/or <em>blog</em> fields completed then if the above link is found
your sites will be indicated to be verified on your profile screen. When
verified they will appear in green with a tick.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-verified-website.jpg"
alt="Profile screen showing verified website" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Profile screen showing verified
website</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<p>If you are the administrator then within your profile settings you
can also specify roles for other accounts on the instance. A small
instance is like a ship with the roles being crew positions, and all
members of the crew need to work together to keep the ship afloat. The
current roles are:</p>
<h3 id="moderator">Moderator</h3>
<p>Is allowed to remove posts and deal with moderation reports.</p>
<h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>
<p>Editors can change the links in the left column and the RSS feeds
within the right newswire column.</p>
<h3 id="artist">Artist</h3>
<p>Artists can change the colors and style of the web interface, using
the <em>theme designer</em>.</p>
<h3 id="counselor">Counselor</h3>
<p>A <em>counselor</em> is someone tasked with resolving disputes
between users of the instance. They are permitted to send DMs to any
user account on the instance. Obviously, this type of power can be
abused and so the administrator should choose counselors with care.</p>
<h3 id="devop">Devop</h3>
<p>Devops are permitted to perform some routine administration
functions, such as monitoring instance performance graphs.</p>
<h1 id="following">Following</h1>
<p><em>“I am not a beginning. I am not an end. I am a link in a
chain.”</em></p>
<p>– Keith Haring</p>
<p>On the main timeline screen at the top right of the centre column
there is a search icon which looks like a magnifying glass. By
convention within the fediverse the search function is also the way to
look up and follow other people. Enter the handle (<span
class="citation" data-cites="name">@name</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="domain">@domain</span>) or URL of the profile page for the
person that you want to follow and select <em>search</em>. If the
account is found then its details will appear and you can choose to
follow or not.</p>
<p><img src="manual-search-following.jpg"
alt="Following people via search" /> <img src="manual-following.jpg"
alt="Following search result" /></p>
<p>Once you are following someone then selecting their profile picture
and then the <em>unfollow</em> button will remove the follow.</p>
<h1 id="creating-posts">Creating posts</h1>
<p>To make a new post from the main timeline screen select the <em>new
post</em> icon at the top right of the centre column.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-new-post.png" alt="New post screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">New post screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The format of the post should be plain text, without any html markup.
Any URLs will be automatically linked, and you can use hashtags and
emoji. Emojis can be added via their name with colon characters before
and after.</p>
<h2 id="post-scopes">Post scopes</h2>
<p>Posts can have different scopes which provide some amount of privacy,
or particular functions. To change the scope select the current one and
a dropdown list will appear.</p>
<h3 id="public">Public</h3>
<p>Is visible to anyone in the fediverse. May also be visible outside of
the fediverse to anyone with an appropriate link.</p>
<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>Used to create a blog post. Blog posts are typically longer than
other types of post, and are also publicly visible to anyone on the
web.</p>
<p>At the top of the <em>links</em> column on the main timeline screen
there is an icon to show an RSS feed for your blog entries.</p>
<h3 id="unlisted">Unlisted</h3>
<p>Similar to a public post, but will not appear as a recent post within
your profile. Unlisted posts can add a little more privacy to a
conversation in that it will not be immediately obvious to casual
observers. Often in practice this is all that’s needed to avoid trolls
or unwanted attention.</p>
<h3 id="followers">Followers</h3>
<p>A <em>followers only</em> post will only be visible to people who are
following you. They will not be visible to people who are not your
followers, or to other observers on the web.</p>
<p>A subtlety of this type of post is that people have different
followers, so if you send to your followers and they send a reply to
their followers then your post or references to it may end up with
people who are not your followers.</p>
<h3 id="dm">DM</h3>
<p>Direct messages are only send to specific people, designated by their
fediverse handles (<span class="citation"
data-cites="name">@name</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="domain">@domain</span>).</p>
<h3 id="reminder">Reminder</h3>
<p>A reminder is a direct message to yourself at some time in the
future. It will appear on your calendar.</p>
<h3 id="report">Report</h3>
<p>A report is a type of post which is sent to moderators on your
instance, to alert them about some problem. It is not sent to any other
instance.</p>
<h3 id="shares">Shares</h3>
<p>A <em>shared item</em> post describes a physical object or service
which may be shared by people on your instance. Shared items may also be
visible to people on specific named instances if that has been set up by
the administrator.</p>
<h3 id="wanted">Wanted</h3>
<p>A <em>wanted item</em> is a physical object or service which you
want. These posts will be visible to other people on your instance and
also to people on specific named instances if that has been set up by
the administrator.</p>
<h2 id="subject-or-content-warning">Subject or Content Warning</h2>
<p>Content warnings are not “censorship” or “hiding important things”.
It’s like the subject line of an email: the reader knows what’s coming
so they may choose when to see it. In a timeline which is strictly
chronological, content warnings can also help you to skip over posts
which obviously are not going to be of interest to you, rather than
depending on a fallible or gameable algorithm to select what is
relevant.</p>
<h2 id="attachments">Attachments</h2>
<p>Attachments can use a variety of formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Images: <em>jpg, jpeg, gif, webp, avif, svg, ico, jxl, png</em></li>
<li>Audio: <em>mp3, ogg, flac, opus, speex, wav</em></li>
<li>Video: <em>mp4, webm, ogv</em></li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="manual-attachments.png" alt="New post attachments" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">New post attachments</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Attachments should be as small as possible in terms of file size.
Videos should be no more than 20 seconds in length. Epicyon is not
suitable for hosting lengthy or high resolution videos, although
podcasts might be feasible.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-watermark-ai.png" alt="Image watermarking" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Image watermarking</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When attaching an image it is possible to overlay a watermark image
in order to mess with generative AI scrapers trying to grift upon your
photos. Epicyon will do it’s best to bounce AI scraper bots, or pollute
them by giving random responses to pollute their training sets, but
since those systems are fundamentally unethical they cannot be relied
upon to follow user agent conventions. A watermark image can be uploaded
from the <strong>Edit Profile</strong> screen under the
<strong>Background Images</strong> section. You may need to experiment
with the watermark image width, position and opacity, which can be set
as command options on the daemon. See <a
href="https://gitlab.com/bashrc2/epicyon/-/blob/main/README_commandline.md">README_commandline.md</a>
for details.</p>
<p>Even if the scraper bot tries to remove your watermark from the image
by filling in from the surrounding pixels, the removal itself may leave
a detectable trace indicative of improper use.</p>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p>You can specify a date, time and location for the post. If a date is
set then the post will appear as an event on the calendar of recipients.
This makes it easy for people to organize events without needing to
explicitly manage calendars. <img src="manual-date-time.png"
alt="New post event" /></p>
<h2 id="maps">Maps</h2>
<p>The location field on a post can be a description, but it can also be
a map geolocation. To add a geolocation go to <a
href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap.org</a>, find your
location and copy and paste the URL into the location field of your new
post.</p>
<p>Selecting the <em>location</em> header will open the last known
geolocation, so if your current location is near this makes it quicker
to find.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-references">Scientific references</h2>
<p>It is possible to have references to scientific papers linked
automatically, such that they are readable with one click/press.
Supported references are <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">Digital
object identifier (DOI)</a>. For example:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>This is a reference to a paper: arxiv:2203.15752</code></pre>
<h2 id="pinned-posts">Pinned posts</h2>
<p>It is possible to pin additional information to your profile page.
This can be done by making a Public scoped post and selecting <em>Pin
this post to your profile</em>.</p>
<p>To clear a pinned post, make a blank Public scoped post and also
select <em>Pin this post to your profile</em>.</p>
<h1 id="the-timeline">The Timeline</h1>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<figure>
<img src="manual-layout.png" alt="Layout" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Layout</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On a desktop system the main timeline screen has a multi-column
layout. The main content containing posts is in the centre. To the left
is a column containing useful web links. To the right is the newswire
containing links from RSS feeds.</p>
<p>At the top right of the centre column there are a few icons known as
<em>action buttons</em>, for show/hide extra timelines, show/hide
announces or boosts, calendar, search and creating a new post.</p>
<p>On mobile screens there is a single column layout, and the
<em>links</em> and <em>newswire</em> column content is available via
action buttons.</p>
<p>Different timelines are listed at the top - inbox, DM, replies,
outbox, etc - and more can be shown by selecting the <em>show/hide</em>
icon.</p>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>As a general principle of navigation selecting the top banner always
takes you back to the previous screen, or if you are on the main
timeline screen then it will alternate with your profile.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the timeline there will usually be an arrow icon to
go to the next page, and a list of page numbers. You can also move
between pages using key shortcuts <strong>ALT+SHIFT+&gt;</strong> and
<strong>ALT+SHIFT+&lt;</strong>. Key shortcuts exist for most navigation
events, and you can customise them by selecting the <em>key
shortcuts</em> link at the bottom of the left column.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-shortcuts.png" alt="Keyboard shortcuts screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Keyboard shortcuts screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="calendar">Calendar</h1>
<p><em>“There is nothing in this world that does not have a decisive
moment”</em></p>
<p>– Henri Cartier-Bresson</p>
<p>The calendar is not yet a standardized feature of the fediverse as a
whole, but has existed in Friendica and Zot instances for a long time.
Being able to attach a date and time to a post and then have it appear
on your calendar and perhaps also the calendars of your followers is
quite useful for organizing things with minimum effort. Until such time
as federated calendar functionality becomes more standardized this may
only work between Epicyon instances.</p>
<p>Calendar events are really just ordinary posts with a date, time and
perhaps also a location attached to them. Posts with <em>Public</em>
scope which have a date and time will appear on the calendars of your
followers, unless they have opted out of receiving calendar events from
you.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-calendar.png" alt="Calendar screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Calendar screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Reminder</em> is a special type of calendar post, which is really
just a direct message to yourself in the future.</p>
<p>To create a calendar post from the main timeline, select the
<strong>New post</strong> icon, then use the dropdown menu to select the
scope of your post. Give your event a description and add a date and
time. If you add a location this can either be a description or a
geolocation link, such as a link to <a
href="https://openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap</a>.</p>
<p>Selecting the calendar icon from the main timeline will display your
calendar events. It is possible to export them using the
<strong>iCalendar</strong> icon at the bottom right to the screen.
Calendar events are also available via <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDav</a> using the URL
https://yourdomain/calendars/yournickname</p>
<h1 id="side-columns">Side columns</h1>
<p><img src="manual-side-columns.png" alt="Timeline side columns" /> The
links within the side columns are global to the instance, and only users
having the <em>editor</em> role can change them. Since the number of
accounts on the instance is expected to be small these links provide a
common point of reference.</p>
<p>This multi-column layout is inspired by the appearance of early blogs
or the original <em>Indymedia</em>, which in turn was inspired by the
appearance of monastic texts in which you would see comments in the
margins in line with the main text. So you can be reading posts from
friends but also keeping an eye on the news from RSS/Atom feeds at the
same time.</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p>Web links within the left column are intended to be generally useful
or of interest to the users of the instance. They are similar to a
blogroll. If you have the <em>editor</em> role there is an edit button
at the top of the left column which can be used to add or remove links.
Headers can also be added to group links into logical sections. For
example:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>* Search

Code search https://beta.sayhello.so
Wiby https://wiby.me/

* Links

16colors https://16colo.rs
Dotshareit http://dotshare.it</code></pre>
<h2 id="newswire">Newswire</h2>
<p>The right column is the newswire column. It contains a list of links
generated from RSS/Atom feeds.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> is a much
maligned protocol. It’s simple, and an excellent way to read news in a
manner that’s convenient for you. The main reason for its downfall is
that it’s difficult to implement <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">targeted
advertising</a> - the dominant business model of the web - within RSS.
It’s hard to spy on anyone using an RSS feed. So if we want the web to
improve then supporting RSS ought to be a priority.</p>
<p>If you have the <em>editor</em> role then an edit icon will appear at
the top of the right column, and the edit screen then allows you to add
or remove feeds.</p>
<h3 id="moderated-feeds">Moderated feeds</h3>
<p>Feeds can be either <em>moderated</em> or not. Moderated feed items
must be approved by a moderator before then can appear in the newswire
column and be visible to other users on the instance. To indicate that a
feed should be moderated prefix its URL with a star character.</p>
<h3 id="mirrored-feeds">Mirrored feeds</h3>
<p>Newswire items can also be mirrored. This means that instead of
newswire items being links back to the original source article a copy
will be made of the article locally on your server. Mirroring can be
useful if the site of the RSS/Atom feed is unreliable or likely to go
offline (such as solar powered systems only online during daylight
hours). When deciding whether to mirror a feed you will also want to
consider the copyright status of the content being mirrored, and whether
legal problems could arise. To indicate that a feed should be mirrored
prefix its URL with an exclamation mark ! character.</p>
<h3 id="filters-and-warnings">Filters and warnings</h3>
<p>On this screen you can also set filtered words and dogwhistle content
warnings for the instance. Filtered words should be on separate lines,
and dogwhistle words can be added in the format:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>dogwhistleword -&gt; content warning to be added
dogwhistle phrase -&gt; content warning to be added
DogwhistleWordPrefix* -&gt; content warning to be added
*DogwhistleWordEnding -&gt; content warning to be added</code></pre>
<h3 id="newswire-tagging-rules">Newswire tagging rules</h3>
<p>As news arrives via RSS or Atom feeds it can be processed to add or
remove hashtags, in accordance to some rules which you can define.</p>
<p>On the newswire edit screen, available to accounts having the
<em>moderator</em> role, you can define the news processing rules. There
is one rule per line.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <em>if [conditions] then [action]</em></p>
<p><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> <em>not, and, or, xor, from,
contains</em></p>
<p>A simple example is:</p>
<pre class="test"><code>if moderated and not #oxfordimc then block</code></pre>
<p>For moderated feeds this will only allow items through if they have
the <strong>#oxfordimc</strong> hashtag.</p>
<p>If you want to add hashtags an example is:</p>
<pre class="test"><code>if contains &quot;garden&quot; or contains &quot;lawn&quot; then add #gardening</code></pre>
<p>So if incoming news contains the word “garden” either in its title or
description then it will automatically be assigned the hashtag
<strong>#gardening</strong>. You can also add hashtags based upon other
hashtags.</p>
<pre class="test"><code>if #garden or #lawn then add #gardening</code></pre>
<p>You can also remove hashtags.</p>
<pre class="test"><code>if #garden or #lawn then remove #gardening</code></pre>
<p>Which will remove <strong>#gardening</strong> if it exists as a
hashtag within the news post.</p>
<p>You can add tags based upon the RSS link, such as:</p>
<pre class="test"><code>if from &quot;mycatsite.com&quot; then add #cats</code></pre>
<h1 id="media-timeline">Media timeline</h1>
<p>Selecting the <em>show/hide</em> icon from the main timeline will
reveal an extra timeline called <strong>Media</strong>. The media
timeline shows posts which contain a picture, audio or video content. So
if you are primarily interested in photos then this timeline can be
useful.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-media.jpg" alt="Media timeline" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Media timeline</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If there is an description for the media then this also appears
within this timeline. Selecting a photo will enlarge it.</p>
<h1 id="moderation">Moderation</h1>
<p>The importance of moderation within social networks can’t be
over-stated. In the early history of the web in which communities tended
to be organized around forum software and mailing lists the typical
pattern went as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Founders initiate the forum</li>
<li>The forum gains popularity and a community grows around it</li>
<li>Trolls show up</li>
<li>The administrator is too nice, believes that all opinions are
equally valid, and refuses to remove trolls or promptly redact their
content</li>
<li>Within somewhere between a couple of days and a few weeks, trolls
set longstanding forum members against each other</li>
<li>Community fails and the forum closes abruptly, leaving only a
404</li>
</ul>
<p>The pattern has been repeated many times. Online communities can take
years to carefully build up and days to destroy. Having good moderation
in place, with clear terms of service and enforced boundaries, can help
to avoid failures or burnout. Being “nice” and accepting all content
tends not to work out well. Such an arrangement is easily hijacked by
people with bad intent.</p>
<h2 id="moderator-timeline">Moderator timeline</h2>
<p>If you have the <em>moderator</em> role then selecting the
<em>show/hide</em> icon from the main timeline will reveal an extra
timeline usually called <strong>Mod</strong>. Selecting this timeline
will take you to the instance moderator timeline, which contains any
moderation reports.</p>

<h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3>
<p>You can filter out posts containing particular words or phrases by
entering the offending text and then selecting the
<strong>Filter</strong> button. You can use the
<strong>Unfilter</strong> button to reverse the decision.</p>
<h3 id="removing-an-offending-post">Removing an offending post</h3>
<p>If a post made on your instance has been reported as violating the
terms of service you can remove it by entering its URL and then
selecting the <strong>Remove</strong> button.</p>
<h3 id="suspending-an-account">Suspending an account</h3>
<p>You can suspend an account on the instance by entering the nickname
and then selecting the <strong>Suspend</strong> button. Accounts are
usually suspended pending investigation into some terms of service
violation. You can use the <strong>Unsuspend</strong> button to
re-enable an account.</p>
<h3 id="instance-level-blocking-of-handles-or-domains">Instance level
blocking of handles or domains</h3>
<p>To block a fediverse handle (nickname@domain), hashtag or domain
enter the thing that you wish to block and then select the
<strong>Block</strong> button. You can do the same with the
<strong>Unblock</strong> button to reverse your decision.</p>
<p>When creating a block you can also add a space followed by any text
describing the reason for the block. Such as:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>annoyingdomain.com A spam instance</code></pre>
<p>If you want to see what is being blocked at the instance level then
select the <strong>Info</strong> button.</p>
<h3 id="web-crawlers-and-search-bots">Web crawlers and search bots</h3>
<p>Most fediverse posts have <em>Public</em> scope, and various web
crawlers routinely try to index them. These are mostly the usual
suspects, such as BigTech companies, but also include lesser known
crawlers such as the British Library. By default all web search bots are
blocked, but the administrator account can enable particular ones.</p>
<p>If you are the administrator of the instance then to see the
currently active web search crawlers edit your profile and select
<strong>Filtering and blocking</strong>, then <strong>Known Web Search
Bots</strong>. The most common ones will appear at the top. To enable
particular ones add their name to <strong>Web Search Bots
Allowed</strong> (one per line).</p>
<h3 id="clearing-the-actor-cache">Clearing the Actor Cache</h3>
<p>If you know that an instance has had a security incident and has
rotated their signing keys then you can clear the cache for that
instance so that their public keys will be refreshed. Enter the domain
name for the instance and then select <strong>Clear Cache</strong>
button.</p>
<h2 id="account-level-moderation">Account level moderation</h2>
<h3 id="filtering-1">Filtering</h3>
<p>From the main timeline select the top banner to go to your profile,
then select the <strong>edit</strong> icon. Open the <strong>Filtering
and blocking</strong> section and then you can specify filtered words or
phrases. Be sure to select <strong>Publish</strong> to finalize your
settings.</p>
<p>You can also filter words within the bio of users making follow
requests. This allows unwanted followers to be automatically rejected if
their bio contains particular words.</p>
<h3 id="blocking-accounts-or-domains">Blocking accounts or domains</h3>
<p>From the main timeline select the top banner to go to your profile,
then select the <strong>edit</strong> icon. Open the <strong>Filtering
and blocking</strong> section and then you can specify <strong>blocked
accounts</strong> or domains (one per line).</p>
<p>When creating a block you can also add a space followed by any text
describing the reason for the block. This can help as a reminder as to
why you blocked someone. Such as:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>chud@chuddydomain.com Slobbering. Ferocious. Carnivorous. Underground.
sealion@endlessreplies.net Another bad faith &quot;debater&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to select <strong>Publish</strong> to finalize your
settings.</p>
<h3 id="federated-blocklists">Federated blocklists</h3>
<p>If you have the admin or moderator role then there is a section
within <strong>Filtering and blocking</strong> called <strong>Blocking
API endpoints</strong>. This can be used to subscribe to remote
blocklist URLs, and may be useful in situations where for example you
have multiple instances set up for an organisation and want them to all
use the same blocklist.</p>
<p>Federated blocklists should be a json endpoint accessible via HTTP
GET, and can either be a simple list of strings, where the strings are
blocked account handles or domains:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>[
  &quot;@asshat@angrychuds.com&quot;,
  &quot;@replyguy@endlessly.replying.net&quot;,
  &quot;tedious.domain&quot;
]</code></pre>
<p>Or they can be a list of dictionaries:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>[
  {
    &#39;id&#39;: 123,
    &#39;username&#39;: &#39;@asshat@angrychuds.com&#39;,
    &#39;email&#39;: &#39;null&#39;,
    &#39;status&#39;: &#39;block&#39;,
    &#39;created_at&#39;: None,
    &#39;updated_at&#39;: None
  },
  {
    &#39;id&#39;: 124,
    &#39;username&#39;: &#39;@replyguy@endlessly.replying.net&#39;,
    &#39;email&#39;: &#39;null&#39;,
    &#39;status&#39;: &#39;block&#39;,
    &#39;created_at&#39;: None,
    &#39;updated_at&#39;: None
  },
  {
    &#39;id&#39;: 125,
    &#39;username&#39;: &#39;@tedious.domain&#39;,
    &#39;email&#39;: &#39;null&#39;,
    &#39;status&#39;: &#39;block&#39;,
    &#39;created_at&#39;: None,
    &#39;updated_at&#39;: None
  }
]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> When subscribing to a federated blocklist
you need to have a high degree of trust in the people maintaining it. If
they turn out to be untrustworthy or malevolent then they can
potentially render your instance useless by blocking all your followed
domains.</p>
<h3 id="replacing-words">Replacing words</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may want to replace words within received posts. This
can be for added clarity, to dissipate annoyance or just for fun.</p>
<p>From the main timeline select the top banner to go to your profile,
then select the <strong>edit</strong> icon. Open the <strong>Filtering
and blocking</strong> section and then you can specify replacements as
follows:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>OldWord -&gt; NewWord
original phrase -&gt; new phrase</code></pre>
<p>These replacements are subjective, such that if you
boost/repeat/announce a post then the original wording will be retained
for recipients.</p>
<h3 id="content-warning-lists">Content warning lists</h3>
<p>Content warning lists are lists of domains and/or keywords which can
be used to append a warning if they appear in the content of an incoming
post. For example, you can have a content warning added if a post
contains links to satire sites, so that you don’t confuse them with real
news and you don’t need to be familiar with every possible satire site.
These types of warnings are opt-in, so if they don’t apply to you then
you don’t have to have any.</p>
<p>From the main timeline select the top banner to go to your profile,
then select the <strong>edit</strong> icon. Open the <strong>Filtering
and blocking</strong> section and look for <strong>“Add content warnings
for the following sites”</strong>. You can then select the types of
warnings to be added to your timeline.</p>
<h2 id="emergencies">Emergencies</h2>
<p>The fediverse is typically calmer than the centralized social
networks, but there can be times when disputes break out and tempers
become heated. In the worst cases this can lead to administrator burnout
and instances shutting down.</p>
<p>If you are the administrator and you are in a situation where you or
the users on your instance are getting a lot of targeted harassement
then you can put the instance into <em>broch mode</em>, which is a type
of temporary allowlist which lasts for between one and two weeks. This
prevents previously unknown instances from sending posts to your
timelines, so adversaries can’t create a lot of temporary instances for
the purpose of attacking yours.</p>
<p>A general observation is that it is difficult to maintain collective
outrage at a high level for more than a week, so trolling campaigns tend
to not last much longer than that. Broch mode allows you to ride out the
storm, while retaining normal communications with friendly
instances.</p>
<p>To enable broch mode the administrator should edit their profile, go
to the instance settings and select the option. Once enabled it will
turn itself off automatically after 7-14 days. The somewhat uncertain
deactivation time prevents an adversary from knowing when to begin a new
flooding attempt, and after a couple of weeks they will be losing the
motivation to continue.</p>
<h1 id="themes">Themes</h1>
<p>Generic-looking user interfaces have become expected for many types
of software, because they are designed to scale up to very large numbers
of users and hence need to be as bland and inoffensive as possible. But
small web systems don’t need appeal to a bland, corporate, imagined
average user. If you are spending significant time using a social
network then being able to customise it and really make it your online
home improves usability.</p>
<h2 id="standard-themes">Standard themes</h2>
<p>Epicyon has multiple standard themes and if you are the administrator
then if you edit your profile and open the <em>Graphic design</em>
section then you can change the current theme for the instance. Users
may need to reload the web page with <em>CTRL+F5</em> in order to see
the changes.</p>
<h2 id="theme-customization">Theme customization</h2>
<p>If you have the <em>artist</em> role then from the top of the left
column of the main timeline you can select the <em>Theme Designer</em>
icon, which usually resembles a paint roller or paint brush. This allows
you to change colors and values for user interface components.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-theme-designer.png" alt="Theme designer screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Theme designer screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1 id="buying-and-selling">Buying and selling</h1>
<p>When creating a new post you have the option of specifying a <em>buy
link</em> This is a link to a web page where you can buy some particular
item. When someone receives the post if they have a compatible instance
then a small shopping cart icon will appear at the bottom of the post
along with the other icons. Clicking or pressing the shopping cart will
then take you to the buying site. It’s a predictable and machine
parsable way indicating that something is for sale, separate from the
post content.</p>
<p>To avoid spam, it is possible for the shopping icon to only appear if
it links to one of an allowed list of seller domains. In this way you
can be confident that you are only navigating to approved sites.</p>
<h1 id="sharing-economy">Sharing economy</h1>
<p>This is intended to add <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Freecycle_Network">Freecycle</a>
type functionality within a social network context, leveraging your
social connections on the instance, or between participating instances,
to facilitate sharing and reduce wasteful consumerism.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-shared-item">Adding a shared item</h2>
<p>When creating a new post one of the scope options is called
<em>shares</em>. You can describe an item or service that you are
willing to share.</p>
<p>Sharing is primarily intended to not require any monetary
transactions, although prices can optionally be added. There are no
payment mechanisms implemented and if that is required then it is
recommended to include details of payment method within the
description.</p>
<p>It is optionally possible to display the shared item on your profile,
which makes it <em>fully public to the whole internet</em>. Only a small
number of shared items can be shown on your profile though, which is
decided via the command option <em>–maxSharesOnProfile</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-new-share.png" alt="Adding a new shared item" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding a new shared item</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="adding-a-wanted-item">Adding a wanted item</h2>
<p>This is the opposite to adding a share in that you are making a post
which indicates that you are wanting some particular thing or
service.</p>
<h2 id="new-shares">New shares</h2>
<p>When new shared items are added then in the left column of the main
timeline screen there will be a section showing recent shares.</p>
<h2 id="shared-and-wanted-items-timelines">Shared and wanted items
timelines</h2>
<p>Any items shared or wanted will appear within timelines, which can be
viewed by selecting the <em>show/hide</em> icon.</p>
<h2 id="federated-shares">Federated shares</h2>
<p>If you are the administrator of the instance then you can specify
other instances with which your local shared items may be federated.
Edit your profile and select the <em>Shares</em> section, then add the
domain names of the instances to share with (one per line). If other
instance administrators also configure their system to share with yours
then this is the ideal mutualistic situation, increasing the set of
things being shared.</p>
<p>The technical implementation of federated shared items currently does
not use ActivityPub, but instead a pull-based system more comparable to
RSS/Atom. This is so that the people doing the sharing always remain in
control of what they are sharing, and can withdraw a share at any time.
A pull-based implementation also makes things considerably harder for
spammers.</p>
<h1 id="search">Search</h1>
<p>To search, select the magnifying glass icon from the top right of the
centre column of the main timeline. This will take you to a separate
screen where you can enter your search query.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-search.jpg" alt="Search screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Search screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Hashtag categories</strong></p>
<p>If you select <em>SHOW MORE</em> at the bottom of the search screen
then this will show all recent hashtags, in alphabetical order. If you
have the <em>editor</em> role then selecting a tag will then allow to to
assign a category to it. In this way you can build up <em>hashtag
categories</em> as a way to group tags together under subject headings.
For example, <em>cake</em> might be under a <em>food</em> category.</p>
<p>The hashtag categories are published as an RSS feed at
https://yourdomain/categories.xml, and editors on other instances can
add those feeds to their newswire. This enables the categorization of
hashtags to be crowdsourced between instances.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for a fediverse handle or profile URL</strong></p>
<p>If you enter a fediverse handle or a URL corresponding to a profile
then the system will try to find it. If successful then a summary of the
found profile will be shown, and you will have the option to
follow/unfollow or view the original upstream profile page. If you are
already following then a different screen will be shown with more
options available.</p>
<p><strong>Searching your posts</strong></p>
<p>To search your own posts prefix the search text with a single quote
character.</p>
<p><strong>Searching hashtags</strong></p>
<p>To search for a hashtag just enter it, complete with the hash
prefix.</p>
<p><strong>Searching shared items</strong></p>
<p>To search for any shared items just enter the text that you want to
search for.</p>
<p><strong>Searching wanted items</strong></p>
<p>To search for a wanted item then enter the text that you want to
search for prefixed by a full stop (period) character.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for skills</strong></p>
<p>To search for accounts having a particular skill, prefix your search
text with a star character.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for emojis</strong></p>
<p>To search for an emoji use its name prefixed by a colon
character.</p>
<h1 id="browsing-in-a-command-shell">Browsing in a command shell</h1>
<p>Since the web interface of Epicyon only needs HTML5 and CSS, it can
work with browsers which don’t implement javascript at all.</p>
<p>Screenshots within the preceding sections all assume that you are
using a common graphical web browser. However, it is also possible to
use Epicyon from a shell browser, such as <a
href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net">Lynx</a>. This may be better
suited for use with screen readers, or if you want to check your social
media while logged into a server via <em>ssh</em>.</p>
<p>If you are using <em>Lynx</em> then you will need to ensure that it
is configured for the <strong>utf-8</strong> character set, and that you
have emoji fonts installed (eg. <strong>noto-fonts-emoji</strong>). Edit
your <em>lynx.cfg</em> file (usually in <em>/etc/lynx.cfg</em>) and
set:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>CHARACTER_SET:utf-8</code></pre>
<p>To avoid annoying questions you may also want to set:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES:TRUE</code></pre>
<p>After logging in you will see a menu, which are shortcuts to
different screens.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-lynx-menu.png"
alt="Menu viewed within a shell browser" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Menu viewed within a shell

<p>Timelines will look something like the following.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-lynx-inbox.png"
alt="Inbox viewed within a shell browser" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Inbox viewed within a shell
browser</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The typical way of refreshing the timeline is to go to the top,
select <strong>Inbox</strong> from the menu, then use
<strong>CTRL-R</strong> to reload.</p>
<h1 id="content-licenses">Content licenses</h1>
<p>ActivityPub posts are really just content on a website and so are
subject to copyright rules. Historically, the copyright status of posts
was always left as ambiguous but in Epicyon for the avoidance of
disputes it is made explicit. Setting the scope of a post, such as being
to followers only, is not sufficient to indicate how that post is
intended to be used.</p>
<p>Content licensing is at the instance level, and set by the
administrator. Log in as the administrator and then go to <em>instance
settings</em>. From there you can set the content license, which should
be the URL for the full license text.</p>
<p>When subsequently creating posts a small copyright icon will appear,
which then links back to the license.</p>
<p>The choice of content license is for the instance administrator to
decide, but it is recommended that <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode">non-commercial
creative commons licenses</a> may be enough to deter some of the worst
abuses of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">personally
identifiable information</a> by BigTech companies.</p>
<h1 id="building-fediverse-communities">Building fediverse
communities</h1>
<p>The great thing about running a small instance is that you can do
things in whatever manner you prefer. What follows is a few guidelines
which may help.</p>
<figure>
<img src="manual-fediverse.png" alt="Fediverse logo" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Fediverse logo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Have a working backup system</strong></p>
<p>Keeping backups is very important, and fortunately with Epicyon this
is a simple process. The Epicyon installation consists only of files in
a directory. There is no database. So just backing up the directory
where it resides - typically <em>/opt/epicyon</em> - is all that you
need to do. Once you have a backup system in place, test that it
works.</p>
<p><strong>The fediverse is not an open source Twitter</strong></p>
<p>This sounds like a trite comment, but if you have members on your
instance coming from Twitter and expecting it to be the same sort of
thing then they will be disappointed. A major difference is that the
fediverse is more about conversation rather than one-way broadcast.
Sites like Twitter encourage you to become an “influencer” and adopt a
style of communication where you are shouting to a large audience
without much expectation of dialogue.</p>
<p>On the website formerly known as Twitter there is an algorithm which
will make follow suggestions and dump all manner of aggravating trash
into your timeline. On the fediverse if you want to connect with people
then you will need to be more proactive in going out to <em>find the
others</em>. There is no algorithm trying to guess what you want without
your participation. Zuckerberg’s Threads is an exception to this, but
the less said about that the better.</p>
<p><strong>Robustly remove bad actors</strong></p>
<p>If people are creating a problem or bringing trouble and are not
amenable to changing their ways, whether they are members of your
instance or not, then be prepared to block or suspend their accounts.
Remember that <em>trolls will destroy your community if you let
them</em>. Define your <em>terms of service</em> and apply it
consistently to anyone interacting with your instance.</p>
<p><strong>Curate your experience</strong></p>
<p>Add links to the left column and blog or podcast feeds to the right.
Choose links which are relevant to your community so that useful
information is one click away. If you have multiple people on your
instance then assign roles to them so that they have a stake in
maintaining a good experience.</p>
<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-the-fediverse">A Brief History of the
Fediverse</h1>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-centralization">The problems with
Centralization</h2>
<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>
<p>When everybody is in a single database the whims of whoever owns that
database become paramount.</p>
<p>Maybe this week the owner doesn’t like the posts of cancer survivors.
Maybe next week they don’t like transgender people. Maybe another week
they don’t like people resisting fascists on the street. All these
accounts can be speedily closed, erasing history, and in practice things
like this have actually happened many times.</p>
<p>Admittedly in the case of the website formerly known as Twitter it
probably isn’t a single server or a single database, but via
virtualization technologies we can consider it to be such. What matters
mostly is who owns and controls the system, and that the system behaves
as a single cohesive entity with a unified policy.</p>
<p>Censorship on sites like Twitter/X and Facebook has been an ongoing
problem for many years. If there has been a trend it has been one of
increasing pressure from nation states to comply with local laws, or
just the wishes of the powerful to suppress inconvenient home truths and
interfere with people organizing protests. Any event with “social action
potential” can transform into a challenge to entrenched power
structures.</p>
<p>Beginning with the Arab Spring in 2011, internet shutdowns became
increasingly common, but even in places where the internet is
operational there can still be domain blocks against the biggest social
network systems. The obvious examples of this is China’s Great Firewall
or Iran’s national internet, but there are many other similar cases of
selective blocking.</p>
<p>Having the ability to avoid censorship, either by the centralized
social networks or by governments at the ISP level is useful, and being
able to run your own social networks is one way of achieving that.</p>
<p>In a federated system some servers may get blocked by censors, but
the rest of the system can still continue to be operational. You get to
decide by what rules the community is governed.</p>
<h3 id="algorithmic-timelines">Algorithmic Timelines</h3>
<p>The algorithmic timeline might seem like a good idea at first. After
all, people have limited time to mess around on social networks so maybe
they just want to see the highlights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it’s never quite that simple. The website formerly
known as Twitter started using an algorithmic timeline in 2016 and
Facebook many years before that. Algorithmic timelines give whoever
controls the system the ability to promote or censor content as they
wish, and their wishes may bear no relationship to the wishes of the
user.</p>
<p><em>“When the linear timeline was removed in favor of their own
algorithmic sort, they removed our control over the conversation
entirely. Instead of you and your friends in discourse with each other,
you’re talking around the sources of content you’re being told to see,
read, and like. You are in direct competition with a corporate notion of
your personal history, identity, and relationships.”</em></p>
<p>In 2012 Facebook used its algorithmic timeline <a
href="https://www.wired.com/2014/06/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-manipulative-experiment/">to
manipulate the emotions of its users</a> in a week long experiment. None
of the experimental subjects gave consent. By promoting or removing
happy or sad content the collective mood could be artificially swayed
one way or another. It’s likely that other similar experiments have
occurred quietly without any media attention.</p>
<p>Algorithmic timelines also mean that different users see a different
version of events. For any given post, maybe you see it now or maybe
later or perhaps not at all, depending upon what the algorithm decides
is priority. This reduces the potential for coordinated activities.</p>
<p>A well known problem with algorithmic timelines is “shadow banning”.
You are sending out posts, but the algorithms decide that they all have
zero ranking priority and so your friends never seem them. You think
you’re communicating, but actually you’re not.</p>
<h3 id="echo-chambers-and-outrage-culture">Echo chambers and outrage
culture</h3>
<p>What happens when you put millions of people from many different
cultures into an online space where they can’t avoid each other? This is
the experiment which the centralized social network systems have been
performing.</p>
<p>People have conflicting opinions and expected norms, so when they’re
in a confined space and don’t have much control over what gets into
their stream they will of course fight with each other.</p>
<p>This can result in endless bickering, ALLCAPS RANTS, harassment,
bikeshedding, egobattles and call-outs. It soon gets emotionally
draining and can have serious psychological and sometimes physical
consequences. The website formerly known as Twitter today is a more or
less endless stream of outrage and neonazi talking points.</p>
<p>The echo chamber is the opposite. You only talk to a small circle of
friends and never meet anyone outside of your ingroup. There’s a lot of
complaining about bubble effects, but in practice this rarely happens
since algorithmic timelines don’t give the user enough control to be
able to remain strictly within their bubble.</p>
<p>The ideal is somewhere between being in a bubble and being in an
overcrowded and antagonistic space suffering from endless linguistic
combat. Federation provides this kind of model.</p>
<h3 id="the-silo-feedback-loop">The Silo Feedback Loop</h3>
<p>The various features of the centralized silo systems create a
feedback loop which encourages “engagement” and enables paying customers
to manipulate opinions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization buys targeted ads</li>
<li>Algorithmic timeline changes to display them</li>
<li>User experience changes due to altered timeline</li>
<li>Analytics of resulting user behaviour</li>
<li>Devise new ad campaign</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>The silo systems can use data mining and machine learning methods to
maximize the engagement of users with ads. Typically the AI will learn
that in order to get the biggest results the ads should target people in
a manner which causes shock and outrage, resulting in furious replies
and flamewars. “Look at this terrible thing!”, etc.</p>
<p>When the ads are of a political or psyops nature obviously this can
have significant adverse effects upon the society if enough targeted
advertising is deployed. Even if the silo system has a policy which
forbids this it’s hard for them to automatically detect political
campaigns which may be quite subtle and manipulative in their messaging.
They also have a strong incentive to take as much money as they can,
regardless of its origin or intentions.</p>
<p>The absence of centrally controlled algorithmic timelines prevents
this kind of feedback loop from being deliberately created within the
fediverse.</p>
<p>If the timeline is purely chronological, or if it’s controlled by the
user, then it’s not possible to buy influence over opinions in the same
manner.</p>
<h3 id="corporate-versus-community-interests">Corporate versus Community
Interests</h3>
<p><em>“Centralised systems lead to increasingly monotonous and
unaccountable power. Over time this encourages exploitation and
disinterest in user needs.”</em></p>
<p>– Irina Bolychevsky</p>
<p>Naive people might believe that Facebook is just a place to hang out
and chat with friends. But there aren’t many folks that naive in
existence anymore.</p>
<p>Facebook doesn’t actually care whether the user experience is good or
not, so long as its advertising customers can target their users and the
money keeps rolling in. This is certainly reflected in the horrible user
interface.</p>
<p>The interests of major internet companies are not necessarily the
same as the interests of internet users. Often the interests are badly
out of alignment.</p>
<p>The companies - especially the big ones - are only concerned about
profits and share holders. Things like keeping Mark Zuckerberg in the
top ten list of oligarchs. They’re not concerned about you or your
community, because you’re small fry and they are the Tech Geniuses
living in McMansions and driving expensive CyberTrucks.</p>
<p>Federation is one way to bring the interests back into alignment and
cut the oligarchs with their inflated egos and self-entitlement out of
the picture. If you keep the number of users on an instance small then
there is not much power differential between the admin and the users,
and probably their concerns are similar.</p>

<p>Decentralized systems can be conceptualized along three axes, forming
the Governance Cube.</p>
<h3 id="logical">Logical</h3>
<p>If you divide the system in half will they continue to function or
fail catastrophically.</p>
<p>Can you combine systems which previously ran separately into a larger
one, without losing any functionality or having clashing
indexes/hashes.</p>
<h3 id="political">Political</h3>
<p>Is the system controlled by a single individual or a single
organization, or is it controlled by many people or different
organizations.</p>
<p>Do you need anyone’s permission to run the system.</p>
<h3 id="architectural">Architectural</h3>
<p>How many computers is the system running on, and how geographically
dispersed are they. Are they all in a single warehouse or in many homes
and offices.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Bitcoin: Logically centralized, Architecturally decentralized (apart
from mining), politically decentralized (mostly)</p>
<p>Traditional corporations: Logically centralized, Architecturally
centralized, Politically centralized</p>
<p>Fediverse: Logically decentralized, Politically decentralized,
Architecturally decentralized. Fediverse might be considered politically
centralized, but only at the instance level.</p>
<p>Signal App: Logically centralized, Politically centralized,
Architecturally centralized (single server)</p>
<p>SSB: Logically decentralized, Politically decentralized,
Architecturally decentralized</p>
<p>A system which was politically centralized but logically and
architecturally decentralized would be where everyone could run their
own solid-like data pods and control permissions to their data, but
identity would be centrally managed by a single organization.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-the-website-formerly-known-as-twitter">Problems
with the website formerly known as Twitter</h2>
<p>Particular problems with Twitter, especially from 2016 onwards after
the introduction of algorithmic timelines were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralised</li>
<li>Proprietary, so forking and doing something better wasn’t an
option</li>
<li>They forced you to ID yourself with a phone number</li>
<li>They handed your data to third party companies</li>
<li>Most governments were using it to ID people saying bad things about
them</li>
<li>Ads and corporate campaigns</li>
<li>Heavy handed censorship, or refusal to remove users who were
violating TOS merely because of their celebrity status</li>
<li>Refusal to deal with obvious bot accounts, used for spying or
creating an economy of fake followers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="peers-and-federalists">Peers and Federalists</h2>
<p>The ideal state of the web would be peer to peer. There would be
perfect scalability due to there being no bandwidth choke points. All
data would be content addressible, replicated and seeded by its users.
DDoS would be practically impossible. Each peer would make their own
decisions about which others to connect to and what data to share.</p>
<p>The web today is the opposite of this, and is increasingly
centralised. Policies about what type of content is permitted or not
tend to be global and defined by the terms of service a few
megacorporations.</p>
<p>Both of these have disadvantages. The centralised web tries to impose
a single standard for connectivity and content onto the whole world. The
peer to peer situation means that each individual is captain of their
own ship and makes their own decisions about who to connect to and what
to share, but this may sometimes involve a lot of duplicated curation
effort.</p>
<p>Federation offers a third way of doing things, in which decisions
about what is or isn’t acceptable may be partly collectivized, but not
to a totalizing extent as in the centralized case. This allows peers to
offload some of their preferences to their affinity group, which may
improve the user experience and reduce cognitive workload. For example,
collective defense against known bad entities.</p>
<h2 id="pseudonymity">Pseudonymity</h2>
<p>After the web 2.0 systems appeared in the mid 2000s so too did a
consensus that “real names” were preferable to pseudonyms.</p>
<p>The thinking was that if users are anonymous then they’re more likely
to indulge in antisocial behavior, because there are likely to be no
real world repercussions.</p>
<p>In the fediverse, as on earlier internet systems, pseudonyms are used
predominantly and there have been no “real name” policies so far.</p>
<p>The evolution of Facebook and to a much lesser extent Google+
provided good evidence that “real names” do not necessarily produce
civility. Instead “real names” are much more about producing a
consistent social graph for use by advertisers. If you know someone’s
specific identity then its much easier to target them with advertising
and send traditional junk mail to their home address.</p>
<p>So the obsession with “real names” was largely about commercial
motives rather than improving the discourse.</p>
<p>Full anonymity where there isn’t a consistent username or where many
users are on the same account is difficult to handle because it makes
spammers hard to block, but pseudonymity where users have a persistent
and unique username/address which is not necessarily linked to any
“legal person” appears to be optimal.</p>
<h2 id="gnu-socialites">GNU Socialites</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social">GNU Social</a> was
released in 2013, based upon the earlier StatusNet code, written in
PHP.</p>
<p>In contrast to the release announcement, which talked of
“professional quality code”, the software contained a large amount of
cruft.</p>
<p>Initial cruft included a lot of links to Google, including long
obsolete Google projects such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Buzz">Buzz</a>. Initial tasks
were to remove any dependencies upon proprietary systems.</p>
<h3 id="the-quitter-era">The Quitter Era</h3>
<p>Between 2013 and 2016 the most popular GNU Social instances ran with
the Qvitter user interface, which closely resembled the earlier and more
user friendly appearance of Twitter, before a lot of junk was added. It
was developed primarily by Hannes Mannerheim from August 2013
onwards.</p>
<p>These instances had domains like quitter.se or quitter.no. They had
explicitly anti-capitalist branding, with “quitter” being a reference to
“quitting Twitter”.</p>
<p>Unlike the classic GNU Social user interface, which was unchanged
from the pre-2012 StatusNet days, Qvitter used javascript. There was
widespread distrust of javascript at that time, so the more security
conscious folks tended to use non-Quitter instances.</p>
<p>During the Quitter Era most users were either Free Software
developers/supporters, or anarchists seeking to socially organize
autonomously from the corporate systems. Anarchist slogans intermingled
with Stallman and GNU memes were common.</p>
<p>By the end of 2016 the main focus of fediverse activity was shifting
away from GNU Social and towards the shiny new Mastodon system.</p>
<h3 id="postactiv">PostActiv</h3>
<p>Development on GNU Social was slow, and mostly confined to
international translations.</p>
<p>As a consequence of slow developent, in 2016 a fork of GNU Social was
created called postActiv . PostActiv was developed by Maiyannah Bishop,
with the aim of tidying the code, adding comments and improving the
message queue buffering.</p>
<p>The postActiv fork was not an acrimonious one, and it was recommended
by the main GNU Social developer, Mikael Nordfeldth.</p>
<h2 id="here-come-the-elephants">Here come the Elephants</h2>
<p>Mastodon started gaining popularity towards the end of 2016. At that
time it was based around a single instance called mastodon.social.</p>
<p>It was initially viewed skeptically by the users of GNU Social
instances, as being a cult based around the personality of its young
developer, Eugen Rochko.</p>
<p>This system was promoted as being like Twitter, but with a zero
tolerance policy towards far right or alt-right agitators. The “lack of
nazis” was enough of a motivator to get some users to move over from
Twitter.</p>
<p>Mastodon introduced a new concept to the fediverse - the content
warning. Content warnings could also be considered as ultra brief
content summaries, allowing the user to rapidly skip over posts which
were probably not of interest.</p>
<p>What content warnings (or one line summaries) allowed users to do was
to follow numbers of other users above the Dunbar limit and without
necessarily having a high degree of affinity with them, while also
avoiding the cognitive overload which would otherwise result. In effect,
content warnings were an alternative to the algorithmic timeline,
producing the same compressing effect without the down sides of
censorship and shadowbans.</p>
<p>People on Twitter had been requesting user interface changes to
improve usability and getting nowhere for years, but were happily
surprised that the Mastodon developer was much more responsive to
suggestions.</p>
<p>Mastodon initially set its character limit to 500 - much higher than
Twitter’s 140 at the time, but typically lower than many GNU Social
instances which defaulted to 2000.</p>
<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
<p>A variety of factors contributed to the early popularity of Mastodon,
and one of those factors was its similarity to an already familiar
Twitter user interface, called Tweetdeck.</p>
<p>From early on Mastodon seems to have attracted many artists, and as a
consequence it tended to have better quality artwork for its logos than
other fediverse projects - and Free Software projects in general.</p>
<h3 id="changing-demographics">Changing demographics</h3>
<p>With the rise of Mastodon in 2017 the gender composition of the
fediverse noticeably changed from being mostly masculine (maybe 80% at a
guess) towards being much more even. Mastodon had broad appeal and
brought in new demographics which were not confined to people interested
in technology.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-million">The First Million</h3>
<p>At the end of 2017 Mastodon had a million user accounts. However,
taking into account that many of those would be dormant, or bots, a more
realistic estimate of active users would between 100 and 200
thousand.</p>
<h3 id="new-design-features">New Design Features</h3>
<p>Mastodon also introduced new design features which were intended to
reduce the potential for harassment. On Mastodon systems you could
search on hashtags, but not do arbitrary searches of an instance for
arbitrary text.</p>
<p>This was an attempt to mitigate lowbrow adversaries who would
otherwise search through the system looking for keywords (like maybe
“feminist”) and then dogpile those users with insulting posts.</p>
<p>Lowbrow dogpiling attacks of this kind had been common on Twitter for
a number of years, so anything which frustrated the most dim-witted
adversaries was still useful.</p>
<p>Mastodon was the first web application in production to adopt
ActivityPub for server-to-server communication, and it was available at
the beginning of 2018.</p>
<h3 id="activitypub-adoption">ActivityPub Adoption</h3>
<p>Mastodon adopted the ActivityPub protocol at the beginning of 2018.
It only used the server-to-server part of the protocol, and not the
server-to-client. The implementation of ActivityPub within Mastodon then
became primary reference for other instance software, such as Pleroma.
The earlier OStatus protocol continued to be supported.</p>
<h3 id="the-decline-and-fall-of-ostatus">The decline and fall of
Ostatus</h3>
<p>In May 2019 the Mastodon project maintainer announced plans to
deprecate the OStatus protocol, which had been superceded by
ActivityPub.</p>
<p><em>“In 3.0, it is time to remove OStatus from Mastodon. Mastodon has
not been designed as a multi-platform system and supporting a legacy
platform creates messy and confusing code. Furthermore, the OStatus code
has not been receiving the same performance and security improvements,
in many parts because the OStatus protocol is inherently less secure in
some aspects.”</em></p>
<h3 id="little-hitlers-and-smalltime-internet-tyrants">Little Hitlers
and smalltime internet tyrants</h3>
<p>In July 2019 the white supremacist social network gab dot com
switched from its formerly proprietary codebase over to using a fork of
Mastodon. This caused a lot of concern among the existing userbase, who
up to that point had been mostly left wing or anarchist. The Mastodon
project blog issued a statement.</p>
<p><em>“Mastodon is completely opposed to Gab’s project and philosophy,
which seeks to monetize and platform racist content while hiding behind
the banner of free speech.”</em></p>
<p>Upon launch gab dot com claimed to have added another million users
to the fediverse, but upon closer scrutiny these figures had been
deliberately inflated via the inclusion of dormant legacy accounts
carried over from their previous database. The site also removed the
active users count which would otherwise reveal the diminutive volume of
their actual userbase.</p>
<p>The appearance of an openly neo-nazi instance accelerated interest in
improving the security and moderation capabilities of Mastodon, and the
discussion of Object Capabilities or “authorized fetch”. Many Mastodon
instances preemptively blocked gab dot com and its affiliated sites even
before they had officially launched, such was the revulsion.</p>
<p>There was also the irony of people espousing extreme hatred of
minority groups adopting a software system largely created by and for
those very same groups. Effectively they were admitting that the
proprietary approach had failed and that software built by people they
viewed as enemies was technically superior to anything that “the master
race” could hamfistedly kludge together themselves.</p>
<h2 id="migrations-and-exoduses">Migrations and Exoduses</h2>
<p>There have been many waves of incoming users. From time to time,
typically once or twice per year, the website formerly known as Twitter,
Facebook or other silo systems will just decide that they don’t like a
certain type of user and begin closing or suspending their accounts or
groups.</p>
<p>In other cases a celebrity will be shadowbanned or suspended, which
then causes a scandal among their followers and a desire for the fandom
to relocate.</p>
<p>These are the biggest exoduses so far:</p>
<h3 id="identi.ca-in-trouble">2011/12: Identi.ca in trouble</h3>
<p>Towards the end of 2011 identi.ca started to experience multi-day or
multi-week outages. Its developer advised that anyone complaining create
their own instances, and thus the first migration wave began out of the
original silo system.</p>
<p>Evan wanted to change the posts size of identi.ca from 140
characters, like Twitter at the time, to something larger. There was a
harsh backlash, so some of those who wanted to maintain the traditional
length created their own federated sites, or used hosted ones which
could be paid for to support the main development.</p>
<p>By that time identi.ca was running out of money and its end was
immanent.</p>
<h3 id="twitters-algorithmic-timeline">2016: Twitter’s Algorithmic
Timeline</h3>
<p>In early 2016 the website formerly known as Twitter introduced an
algorithmic timeline. Algorithmic timelines mean that the posts which
other users see depend upon an opaque algorithm created by the company.
The result is that it’s possible to post to the system but not be seen
by anyone, or whoever your target audience is. This is known as “shadow
banning”.</p>
<p>The combined effects of shadow banning plus overt censorship resulted
in a large influx into the fediverse. At times my GNU Social stream was
a crazy firehoze of all kinds of random stuff.</p>
<p>The established Quitter instances were soon overloaded with users,
and as a consequence new instances were set up. The most notable of
these was shitposter.club.</p>
<h3 id="mastodon-goes-viral">2017: Mastodon goes Viral</h3>
<p>Around about April 2017 Mastodon went viral. It started getting lots
of mentions on the website formerly known as Twitter, and some
mainstream technology journalists were writing about it. Many people
thought it was new - which was true, but only in a narrow sense - and
likely to become The Next Big Thing.</p>
<p>Once again there was a large exodus of users out of Twitter and into
the fediverse. My stream was going crazy, with hundreds of posts every
few minutes.</p>
<p>This exodus was more driven by hype than by Twitter doing anything
especially bad to its users. By that time most users had accepted and
internalized the fact that the site had become a perpetual dumpster fire
of hostility and unwanted content.</p>
<p>The technology journalism about Mastodon was of a comically poor
standard. Most journalists fundamentally misunderstood the main concepts
and so ended up making irrelevant criticisms. They mostly suffered from
fediverse culture shock.</p>
<p>Prior to the Mastodon craze, its developer had placed some ads for it
on the website formerly known as Twitter. Twitter being a bunch of
clueless corporate drones, they weren’t smart enough to realise that
they were advertising a competing system. The ads almost certainly
targeted technology journalists.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-the-one-true-instance">End of the One True Instance</h4>
<p>In late 2016 and early 2017, prior to going viral, Mastodon had
existed as a single instance - mastodon.social. During that time it was
heavily criticized for its OStatus federation bugs, and there seemed to
be little interest in federating with anyone. Instead it looked like
mastodon.social was aiming to be a centralized single server Twitter
clone. Like Twitter, but with a lot less tolerance for bad behavior and
a strong stance against hitlerites.</p>
<p>Once it went viral there was no way that Mastodon could remain a
single server affair with a monolithic and insular culture, and they had
to become more serious about making the federation features work for
real.</p>
<p>As is the case with each new wave of incoming users, many new
instances were set up and many of them were subsequently abandoned, or
failed to keep backups and then had database corruption or a failed hard
drive. There is always some rate of attrition. But many Mastodon
instances remained viable, with enthusiastic new communities forming
around them. The fediverse was going well beyond it’s traditional Free
Software user base, appealing to entirely new and diverse
demographics.</p>
<h4 id="celebrity-bounce">Celebrity Bounce</h4>
<p>In the April time frame various celebrities from the website formerly
known as Twitter tried joining the fediverse via Mastodon. At some point
William Shatner tried and failed to register an account or find a
journalist named Lance Ulanoff. Both of them failed to understand that
this system wasn’t identical to Twitter in the way it works. Adafruit
and a number of others also started accounts, typically on the main
mastodon.social instance.</p>
<p>But none of these celebrity accounts lasted for long. A month or two
at most. They soon realized that they would not be able to cultivate a
mass audience in the fediverse, nor would the fediverse in any way
shield them from legitimate criticism or spoof accounts mocking their
cluelessness.</p>
<p>It seems that the phemonena of celebrity requires a centralized
broadcast culture together with a legal system able to enforce personal
brands, and the fediverse does not fit that model very well at all.</p>
<h4 id="replacing-the-twitterbots">Replacing the Twitterbots</h4>
<p>Before 2017 there had been GNU Social based bots set up to import
posts from the website formerly known as Twitter for certain accounts.
After Mastodon went viral this was no longer needed so much, because
people on Twitter either moved over or maintained a fediverse account.
An example of this was Roy Schestowitz.</p>
<h3 id="a-perfect-storm">2018: A perfect storm</h3>
<p>In 2018 the exoduses didn’t let up.</p>
<p>In April the first instance for sex workers appeared. This was in
response to the SESTA act in the US, which made the more mainstream
sites nervous about hosting anything which might be related to sex work
of any kind, and as a consequence began the large scale purging of
accounts which might be related to that. The Switter instance rapidly
grew to host a large number of users displaced from various other sites
by the new law.</p>
<p>In August a combination of dreadful decisions made by the CEO of
Twitter resulted in a kind of perfect storm in which at its peak 17,000
new users arrived in a single day.</p>
<p>The factors creating the August Twitter storm were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the Twitter API, resulting in client apps breaking</li>
<li>A witch hunt against Terms of Service violators, almost certainly
automated via AI rather than manual vetting. Violations were often silly
things taken out of context from tweets a year or more old</li>
<li>It became increasingly obvious that the Twitter CEO’s decisions were
politically motivated, leading many users to consider themselves unsafe
on that platform</li>
<li>Closing the alt accounts of Twitter users in an attempt to
consolidate a singular identity in the same manner as Facebook. Users
often had multiple accounts for different purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In early December there was another exodus, this time from Tumblr
which had adopted a new policy of banning adult content. Like Facebook,
Tublr tried to use AI to detect images containing what it called
“female-presenting nipples”, but the AI was hopelessly bad and caused an
avalanche of false positives resulting in account suspensions.</p>
<p>In the same week that Tublr began its purge of adult content Facebook
also changed its terms of service to follow suit in what appeared to be
a coordinated takedown. Facebook’s new terms forbade pretty much
anything even tangentally related to sex, including things such as the
discussion of sexual orientation or partner preferences.</p>
<p>Also in 2018 Google announced that its social network service, known
as Google+, would soon be closed. The fediverse gained some new people
as a result, although by that time the number of users on Google+ had
dwindled to a small community.</p>
<p>By the end of 2018 Facebook’s AI moderation was becoming more of a
problem for the average user of that system. Even expressing frustration
in some mild forms, such as “men are trash!”, was enough to result in
account suspension due to the misidentification of hate speech.</p>
<h3 id="tyrannical-tendencies">2019: Tyrannical tendencies</h3>
<p>With its launch in 2016 and first wave of success in early 2017
Mastodon had badged itself as the system which doesn’t accept nazis.</p>
<p>Up until 2019 migrations into the fediverse had been fairly benign
and with a large LGBTQ quotient. But 2019 was the first case of what
might be described as a hostile migration.</p>
<p>The neo-nazi site gab dot com moved its operations from its
previously failed proprietary server over to using a fork of Mastodon.
This caused a lot of alarm among existing fediverse users and instance
admins. Gab had already been banned from silo sites due to its promotion
of extreme hatred and support for acts of terrorism including mass
shootings.</p>
<p>Even before gab dot com officially re-launched at the beginning of
July fediverse admins were pre-emptively blocking federation with the
site.</p>
<p>One fediverse Android app called Tusky took a stand by building the
block on gab dot com directly into its codebase. Another app called
Fedilab announced that it would do the same, but then mysteriously
backpeddled on the decision, raising questions about its political
bias.</p>
<p>Anti-feminists attempting to spread hatred of people in the LGBT
community also used the Gab fork of Mastodon on a site called spinster,
forming an axis alliance with the nazis.</p>
<p>But the scourge of nazi boot-lickers proved to be more of a damp
squib than a Cyber-Blitzkrieg. Their instances were very isolated and
their user counts were enormously over-inflated in keeping with the
possession of a dictatorially grandiose mindset (windbags plotting world
domination while having a handful of real followers and a large number
of bots spewing conspiratorial nonsense).</p>
<p>At the end of the year one analysis discovered that of the active
users on gab dot com over 90% were news bots, with only a small number
of genuinely active accounts.</p>
<p>The lesson from the nazi migration is that containment can be a
fairly successful strategy if there is enough education about the
threat. Like an immune system isolating a dangerous pathogen. Left to
their own devices the nazis resort to turning on their own, and their
ability to mobilize and recruit becomes severely constrained.</p>
<p>A group with a centralized way of thinking and organizing also tends
to fare poorly within the jungle of decentralized horizontalists. It was
only really within the silo systems that they could reach a mass
audience.</p>
<h3 id="india-arrives">2019: India Arrives</h3>
<p>In November there was a major exodus from India into the fediverse,
after an Indian supreme court lawyer, Sanjay Hegde, was banned from the
website formerly known as Twitter resulting in a political storm in
which the Blue Bird Site was accused, unsurprisingly, of yet another
case of bias. Hegde had been critical of right wing government and had
posted a classic 1930s photo of many nazis saluting but one person
conspicuously refusing to do so.</p>
<h3 id="spanish-exodus">2019: Spanish exodus</h3>
<p>In December the website formerly known as Twitter had a purge of
Spanish leftists. Many of them showed up in the fediverse, and on
Twitter they used the hashtag <strong>YoMigroAMastodon</strong> to
encourage others to leave.</p>
<h3 id="chaos-computer-club">2019: Chaos Computer Club</h3>
<p>At the annual congress Mastodon was significantly more referenced
than in the previous two years, and some speakers asked the audience to
give feedback via Mastodon hashtags.</p>
<h3 id="the-muskening">2022: The Muskening</h3>
<p>In November, the oligarch Elon Musk, known for electric vehicles and
spacecraft, purchased the website formerly known as Twitter. One of his
first decisions was to fire most of the moderators. Admittedly, the
moderators of Twitter did an abysmal job in the years leading up to the
acquisition, but becoming an unmoderated space did not go down well with
many users or advertising customers. This resulted in perhaps the
biggest exodus up to that time.</p>
<h3 id="facebook-joins-the-fediverse">2023: Facebook joins the
fediverse</h3>
<p>In August Facebook launched its own fediverse instance, known as
Threads. This was a cynical attempt to scoop up disgruntled Twitter
users looking for an alternative social media site due to the chaos
being created by its new owner, Elon Musk. There was a lot of concern
about the evil empire of Zuckerberg joining the fediverse, and possibly
squashing it by sheer weight of numbers. A website called <a
href="https://fedipact.online">fediPact</a> was created on which
administrators could express their intention to block the Facebook
instance. Many people had come to the fediverse precisely to get away
from harassment on Facebook or Twitter, so the prospect of BigTech
companies showing up in the fediverse and perhaps taking it over was
scary.</p>
<h3 id="facebook-integration-and-the-social-web-foundation">2024:
Facebook integration and the Social Web Foundation</h3>
<p>In June, Zuckerberg expanded the availability of Threads - which had
previously been an early beta release - to 100 countries and enabled
users on his servers to post to the wider fediverse on the open web.</p>
<p>In September the <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org">Social Web
Foundation</a> was launched by identica founder and original ActivityPub
specification author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Prodromou">Evan Prodromou</a>,
to help create a <em>“growing, healthy, financially viable and
multi-polar Fediverse”</em>. Given the history of Free Software related
foundations (such as the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org">Linux
Foundation</a>) there was scepticism about the motives of this new
foundation.</p>
<p>In November the website formerly known as Twitter changed it’s terms
of service such that any posts made by users, including attached images
or videos, could be used worldwide and royalty-free to train its
generative AI model and produce derivative grifter-oriented content.
This resulted in another exodus and shutdowns of Twitter accounts in
order to try to forestall such abuses of content.</p>
<h3 id="mastodon-non-profit-and-facebook-fires-fact-checkers">2025:
Mastodon non-profit and Facebook fires fact checkers</h3>
<p>To kick off the start of the year Mark Zuckerberg, believed to be a
major funder of the Social Web Foundation, announced that he would “get
rid of fact checkers” and that there would consequently be “more bad
stuff” on his platforms, including Threads. Less reported but perhaps
more consequentially, Zuck also altered Meta’s moderation policy to be
more hostile towards women and the LGBTQ community, by removing
protections which previously existed.</p>
<p>The Mastodon project announced that it was setting up a non-profit
and would transfer copyrights and assets to it. The intention was to
avoid the project being controlled by a single individual. <em>“The
people should own the town square”</em>.</p>
<p>By the end of January, after Elon Musk was recorded unambiguously
doing antisemitic Hitler salutes and his association with hitlerite
scumbags became more widely understood the momentum for institutions -
especially in Europe - to leave the website formerly known as Twitter
accelerated. In terms of public relations, once certain images and
videos are out there then there isn’t any going back, and the
reputational damage becomes permanent. Most of the movement away from
Twitter was to BlueSky, but some also joined Mastodon.</p>
<h3 id="fediverse-culture-shock">Fediverse culture shock</h3>
<p>This is what happens when someone has only had a presence within
large corporate sites, such as the website formerly known as Twitter or
Facebook, and then moves to a federated system on the open internet.</p>
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not understanding that there is no single company behind it all</li>
<li>Someone else must take responsibility for XYZ</li>
<li>There is no viable business model here, so this must be a passing
fad</li>
<li>I need to create my preferred username before someone else uses
it</li>
<li>I don’t like the name “Mastodon”</li>
<li>The fediverse is too fractured. I cannot spam millions of adoring
fans with my latest hot take.</li>
<li>Why are there no adverts?</li>
<li>Registering an account on each instance</li>
</ul>
