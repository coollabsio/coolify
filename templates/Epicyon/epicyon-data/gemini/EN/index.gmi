Epicyon is for people who are tired of Big Anything and just want to DIY their online social experience without much fuss or expense. Think "water cooler discussions" rather than "shouting into the void", in which you're mainly just reading and responding to the posts of people that you're following.

## An Internet of People, Not Corporate Agendas

Epicyon is written in Python with a HTML+CSS web interface and uses no javascript which makes display in a web browser very lightweight. It can run as a Progressive Web App on mobile. Just say "no" to boring social media sites packed with generic adverts and zombified corporate influencers.

Emojis, hashtags, photos, video and audio attachments, instance and account level blocking controls, moderation functions and reports are all supported. Build the community you want and avoid the stuff you don't. No ads. No blockchains or other Silicon Valley garbage.

## Community not Audience

Corporate social media gives you an audience, with reach, celebrity, spectacle, lack of control, professional influencers, anxiety, alienation and competition. It's designed for fast growth regardless of social consequences, often where the contents of your feed or timeline is rigged rather than having anything to do with what you are interested in. Epicyon is designed for community, in which you have more control over who you're associating with. The community approach is the better way to build a habitable internet for the long term.
