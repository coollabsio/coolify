# Roadmap

## UX
 * Layout of buttons on person options screen

## Groups

 * Groups can be defined as having particular roles/skills
 * Think of a way to display groups. Maybe assign a hashtag and display them like hashtag timelines

## Questions

 * Instance-only questions
 * Active polls screen?
 * Questions more integrated into overall organization

## Code

 * More unit test coverage
 * Break up large functions into smaller ones
 * Code documentation?

## E2EE

There is some indication that W3C may add E2EE to the ActivityPub spec. If they do this then consider the best way to add it. It may mean giving up on the "no javascript" policy, or it could be something only usable via a C2S client. https://github.com/swicg/activitypub-e2ee
