### Shared items
These are typically physical objects or local services, exchanged or given away without use of money.

For example, you may want to share **equipment** between members of a sports team on the same instance, share any surplus **clothing**, share **gadgets** which you are no longer using, or share plants and gardening **tools** between people using the same growing space.

To avoid spam, shared items are not federated via ActivityPub and are local to members on the same instance.
