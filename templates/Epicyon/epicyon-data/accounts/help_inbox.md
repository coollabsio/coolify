Incoming posts will appear here, as a chronological timeline. If you send any posts they will also appear here.

### The top banner
At the top of the screen you can select the **banner** to switch to your profile, and edit it or log out.

### Timeline buttons and icons
The **buttons** below the top banner allow you to select different timelines. There are also **icons** on the right to **search**, view your **calendar** or create **new posts**.

The **show/hide** icon allows more timeline buttons to be shown, along with moderator controls.

### Left column
Here you can add **useful links**. This only appears on desktop displays or devices with larger screens. It is similar to a *blogroll*. You can only add or edit links if you have an **administrator** or **editor** role.

If you are on mobile then use the **links icon** at the top to read news.

### Right column
RSS feeds can be added in the right column, known as the *newswire*. This only appears on desktop displays or devices with larger screens. You can only add or edit feeds if you have an **administrator** or **editor** role, and incoming feed items can also be moderated.

If you are on mobile then use the **newswire icon** at the top to read news.
