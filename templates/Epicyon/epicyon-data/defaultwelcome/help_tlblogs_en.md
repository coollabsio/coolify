This timeline contains any blogs written by you or anyone that you're following.

You can create a new blog post using the **publish** icon at the top of the right column.

Blog posts are different from ordinary fediverse posts. They use the ActivityPub *Article* type, which is intended for long-form writing. They can also have citations, selected from items in the newswire.
