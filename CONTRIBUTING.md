## 1. Setup Development Environment

Follow the steps below for your operating system:

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

1. Install `docker-ce`, Docker Desktop (or similar):
   - Docker CE (recommended):
     - Install Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2) by following this guide: [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install?ref=coolify)
     - After installing WSL2, install Docker CE for your Linux distribution by following this guide: [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/?ref=coolify)
     - Make sure to choose the appropriate Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) when following the Docker installation guide
   - Install Docker Desktop (easier):
     - Download and install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/?ref=coolify)
     - Ensure WSL2 backend is enabled in Docker Desktop settings

2. Install Spin:
   - Follow the instructions to install Spin on Windows from the [Spin documentation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-windows#download-and-install-spin-into-wsl2?ref=coolify)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MacOS</strong></summary>

1. Install Orbstack, Docker Desktop (or similar):
   - Orbstack (recommended, as it is a faster and lighter alternative to Docker Desktop):
     - Download and install [Orbstack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/quick-start#installation?ref=coolify)
   - Docker Desktop:
     - Download and install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/?ref=coolify)

2. Install Spin:
   - Follow the instructions to install Spin on MacOS from the [Spin documentation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-macos/#download-and-install-spin?ref=coolify)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>

1. Install Docker Engine, Docker Desktop (or similar):
   - Docker Engine (recommended, as there is no VM overhead):
     - Follow the official [Docker Engine installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/?ref=coolify) for your Linux distribution
   - Docker Desktop:
     - If you want a GUI, you can use [Docker Desktop for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/?ref=coolify)

2. Install Spin:
   - Follow the instructions to install Spin on Linux from the [Spin documentation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-linux#configure-docker-permissions?ref=coolify)

</details>

## 2. Verify Installation (Optional)

After installing Docker (or Orbstack) and Spin, verify the installation:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   spin --version
   ```
   You should see version information for both Docker and Spin.

## 3. Fork and Setup Local Repository

1. Fork the [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) repository to your GitHub account.

2. Install a code editor on your machine (choose one):

   | Editor | Platform | Download Link |
   |--------|----------|---------------|
   | Visual Studio Code (recommended free) | Windows/macOS/Linux | [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?ref=coolify) |
   | Cursor (recommended but paid) | Windows/macOS/Linux | [Download](https://www.cursor.com/?ref=coolify) |
   | Zed (very fast) | macOS/Linux | [Download](https://zed.dev/download?ref=coolify) |

3. Clone the Coolify Repository from your fork to your local machine
   - Use `git clone` in the command line, or
   - Use GitHub Desktop (recommended):
     - Download and install from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/?ref=coolify)
     - Open GitHub Desktop and login with your GitHub account
     - Click on `File` -> `Clone Repository` select `github.com` as the repository location, then select your forked Coolify repository, choose the local path and then click `Clone`

4. Open the cloned Coolify Repository in your chosen code editor.

## 4. Set up Environment Variables

1. In the Code Editor, locate the `.env.development.example` file in the root directory of your local Coolify repository.
2. Duplicate the `.env.development.example` file and rename the copy to `.env`.
3. Open the new `.env` file and review its contents. Adjust any environment variables as needed for your development setup.
4. If you encounter errors during database migrations, update the database connection settings in your `.env` file. Use the IP address or hostname of your PostgreSQL database container. You can find this information by running `docker ps` after executing `spin up`.
5. Save the changes to your `.env` file.

## 5. Start Coolify

1. Open a terminal in the local Coolify directory.
2. Run the following command in the terminal (leave that terminal open):
   ```bash
   spin up
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> You may see some errors, but don't worry; this is expected.

3. If you encounter permission errors, especially on macOS, use:
   ```bash
   sudo spin up
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you change environment variables afterwards or anything seems broken, press Ctrl + C to stop the process and run `spin up` again.

## 6. Start Development

1. Access your Coolify instance:
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Login: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `password`

2. Additional development tools:
   | Tool | URL | Note |
   |------|-----|------|
   | Laravel Horizon (scheduler) | `http://localhost:8000/horizon` | Only accessible when logged in as root user |
   | Mailpit (email catcher) | `http://localhost:8025` | |
   | Telescope (debugging tool) | `http://localhost:8000/telescope` | Disabled by default |

> [!NOTE]
> To enable Telescope, add the following to your `.env` file:
> ```env
> TELESCOPE_ENABLED=true
> ```

## 7. Create a Pull Request

1. After making changes or adding a new service:
   - Commit your changes to your forked repository.
   - Push the changes to your GitHub account.

2. Creating the Pull Request (PR):
   - Navigate to the main Coolify repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Pull requests" tab.
   - Click the green "New pull request" button.
   - Choose your fork and branch as the compare branch.
   - Click "Create pull request".

3. Filling out the PR details:
   - Give your PR a descriptive title.
   - Use the Pull Request Template provided and fill in the details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always set the base branch for your PR to the `next` branch of the Coolify repository, not the `main` branch.

4. Submit your PR:
   - Review your changes one last time.
   - Click "Create pull request" to submit.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure your PR is out of draft mode as soon as it's ready for review. PRs that are in draft mode for a long time may be closed by maintainers.

After submission, maintainers will review your PR and may request changes or provide feedback.

## Development Notes

When working on Coolify, keep the following in mind:

1. **Database Migrations**: After switching branches or making changes to the database structure, always run migrations:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it coolify php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Resetting Development Setup**: To reset your development setup to a clean database with default values:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it coolify php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter unexpected behavior, ensure your database is up-to-date with the latest migrations and if possible reset the development setup to eliminate any environment-specific issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Forgetting to migrate the database can cause problems, so make it a habit to run migrations after pulling changes or switching branches.

## Resetting Development Environment

If you encounter issues or break your database or something else, follow these steps to start from a clean slate (works since `v4.0.0-beta.342`):

1. Stop all running containers `ctrl + c`.

2. Remove all Coolify containers:
   ```bash
   docker rm coolify coolify-db coolify-redis coolify-realtime coolify-testing-host coolify-minio coolify-vite-1 coolify-mail
   ```

3. Remove Coolify volumes (it is possible that the volumes have no `coolify` prefix on your machine, in that case remove the prefix from the command):
   ```bash
   docker volume rm coolify_dev_backups_data coolify_dev_postgres_data coolify_dev_redis_data coolify_dev_coolify_data coolify_dev_minio_data
   ```

4. Remove unused images:
   ```bash
   docker image prune -a
   ```

5. Start Coolify again:
   ```bash
   spin up
   ```

6. Run database migrations and seeders:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it coolify php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
   ```

After completing these steps, you'll have a fresh development setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always run database migrations and seeders after switching branches or pulling updates to ensure your local database structure matches the current codebase and includes necessary seed data.
