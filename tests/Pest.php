|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

| When you're writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. The

| to assert different things. Of course, you may extend the Expectation API at any time.

| project that you don't want to repeat in every file. Here you can also expose helpers as
| global functions to help you to reduce the number of lines of code in your test files.
