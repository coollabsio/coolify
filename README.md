# About the Project

Coolify is an open-source & self-hostable alternative to Heroku / Netlify / Vercel / etc. 

It helps you to manage your servers, applications, databases on your own hardware, all you need is SSH connection. You can manage VPS, Bare Metal, Raspberry PI's anything.

Image if you could have the ease of a cloud but with your own servers. That is **Coolify**.

No vendor lock-in, which means that all the configuration for your applications/databases/etc are saved to your server. So if you decide to stop using Coolify (oh nooo), you could still manage your running resources. You just lose the automations and all the magic. 🪄️
